Selenium Class 3

Why do we need Xpath and Css Selector?
-- developers will not provide all the locators in html
-- by using xpath and css we can identify elements with any given attributes

What is an Xpath?
-- xpath is like a query language which helps us to identify elements
uniquely on the web page

Types of Xpath:
Absolute Xpath --> starts from the starting node in html
                    it always starts with single slash (/)
                    e.g. /html/body/div/div/div

Relative Xpath --> starts from any node in the html
                    it always starts with double slash (//)

Syntax for relative xpath:
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']

Example: //input[@id = 'email']

Identifying elements by its text:
//tagname[text() = 'text value']

Example:
//h2[text() = 'Connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook.']
//a[text() = 'Create new account']

identifying elements by using contains method
//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]

Example:
//input[contains(@placeholder, 'Email')]

Starts-with will identify the element with partial starting value
//tagname[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value')]

Example: //button[starts-with(@data-testid, 'royal')]

ends-with was used in xpath 1.0, we are using 2.0 and this method is not available


<div>-- division
<img> -- image
<h> -- header
<li> -- paragraph
<ul>-- unordered list
<ol> -- ordered list
<br>-- breaking line


Advanced Xpath:
is based on parents & child siblings relationship


Identifying elements by following sibling
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/following-sibling::tagname

Identifying elements by preceding siblings
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/preceding-sibling::

//span[text()='& Orders']/preceding-sibling::span

//input[@id='calFormDate']/preceding-sibling::label

identifying elements by parents
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/parent::parentTagName

//span[text() = '& Orders']/parent::a

identifying an element by its ancestor
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/ancestor::ancestorTagname

//input[@id = 'email']/ancestor::form

identifying element by index

(//img[@class = 'ui-datepicker-trigger'])[2]
