Selenium Class 06


Alerts:
Alert is popup message. Alert takes a complete focus of our main page that we are working on.
We can not proceed until it is clicked.

3 types of Alert
1-Web base alerts/HTML alerts-we can simply inspect and perform need action
2- Javascript alerts /browser alerts- we can handle these alerts by using "switchTo" method
                                       we cannot inspect.
3- Windows based Alerts-  we "cannot" handle with Selenium.

types of Java Scripts Alerts:
1. Simple Alerts- click ok
2. confirmation alerts - either cancel or click
3. prompt alerts- enter the text and click ok

To handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods:
1. accept() - click Ok
2. dismiss() - click cancel
3. getText() -
4. sendKeys()

To handle authentication alrets we need to pass username & password in th URL
http://username:password@URL


Frames
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage
Frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page

3 ways to interact with Frames:
1. by index
2. by name or ID
3. by WebElement

in alerts - switch to alert and switch automatically back
in frames - switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to the main page
